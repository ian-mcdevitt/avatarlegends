# Avatar Legends

A simple, unofficial [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) system for [Magpie Games](https://magpiegames.com/)'s [Avatar Legends: The RPG](https://magpiegames.com/pages/avatarrpg).

## Overview

This system is released under the MIT license described in [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt), and its copyright belongs to its contributors.

Forked from the [Monster of the Week System](https://gitlab.com/3cell/monsterweek.git).

## Changes I'd like to make:

* Huge fucking nomenclature cleanup (hunter, monster, weapon, gear, ideal, etc., etc.)
* Translation file cleanup
* NPCs should have their own actor type (they have no moves, stats, backgrounds, or growth)
* PCs should have somewhere to put demeanor, training, fighting style, connections, notes
* Character sheet needs to be way less ugly
* Techniques should have fields for playbook, training type, approach, learned level
* Moves should have fields for basic/balance/playbook/needed-for-the-game-to-work, which playbook it belongs to if playbook, associated stat (instead of "rating")
* Try to make Conditions actually modify moves?
* Make a way to view all PCs' fatigue/conditions/balance (for the GM) or all PCs' balance (for PCs)
* Once the above is done, allow PCs to roll with other PCs' principles
* Add a way to roll with an NPC's principle?
* Make statuses/conditions a series of booleans
* Once the above is done, add a "taken out" indicator if fatigue and conditions are maxed
* Actual fields for forward/ongoing (with scope levels: all, )
